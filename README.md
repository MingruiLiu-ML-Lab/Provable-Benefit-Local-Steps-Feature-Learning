# Provable-Benefit-Local-Steps-Feature-Learning
This is a repo for ICML 2024 paper: Provable Benefits of Local Steps in Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Neural Networks: A Feature Learning Perspective

## Installation

The only requirement is PyTorch. You can follow [PyTorch's instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) to install PyTorch however you like, but we have only tested in this code in a Conda environment with PyTorch 1.12.1 and CUDA 11.3, which can be installed with the following command:
```
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

## Running the Code
Todo.
